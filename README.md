# Visualizing clustering results in R
Recently I thought about how to visualize the result of a cluster analysis. I do not mean the visualization of the clusters itself but the results in terms of content and variable description â€“ something you could give away to someone who does not understand the mechanics of cluster algorithms and just want to see a description of the resulting clusters.
